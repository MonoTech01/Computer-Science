# Data Fundamentals

## Data Defined

- **Data**: Basic values or facts. Scientifically, 'data' is plural (e.g., "the data are collected").
- **Importance**: Fundamental to all computer tasks; understanding representation and organization is crucial.

## Analog vs. Digital Data

- **Analog Data**: Continuous, analogous to real-world phenomena (e.g., natural color spectrum).
- **Digital Data**: Discrete, finite; represented in binary form (e.g., digital images with limited colors).

## Types of Data in Computing

- **Foundational Data**: Text and numbers.
- **Modern Multimedia**: Audio, images, graphics, video—all stored as binary digits.
- **Conversion Techniques**: Specific methods to translate binary data for sensory interpretation (sight, sound).

## Databases

- **Database**: Organized collection of data.
- **Table Structure**:
  - **Fields (Columns)**: Categories of data (e.g., Customer ID, Name, Telephone Number).
  - **Records (Rows)**: Individual entries (e.g., specific customer details).
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: Software for managing large databases (input, storage, retrieval).

## Data vs. Information

- **Data**: Unprocessed, raw values or facts (e.g., lists of text or numbers).
- **Information**: Processed data with context and structure to answer specific questions (e.g., customer details linked to purchase history).

## Terms and Definitions

- **Data**: Basic values or facts; plural in scientific use.
- **Analog Data**: Continuous and representative of real-world phenomena.
- **Digital Data**: Discrete, finite, in binary form.
- **Database**: Organized collection of data.
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: Specialized software for database management.
- **Table (in database)**:
  - **Field (Column)**: Category of data.
  - **Record (Row)**: Individual data entry.

## Lesson Summary

- **Data** are essential values or facts used by computers.
- **Analog vs. Digital**: Continuous versus discrete data.
- **Data Types**: Text, numbers, multimedia—all in binary.
- **Databases**: Organized data in tables; managed by DBMS.
- **Data vs. Information**: Unprocessed data becomes informative with context.
