# Types of Computer Storage

## Introduction

* **Computer Storage:**  Devices used to store digital data permanently or temporarily.
* **Categories:** Optical, magnetic, and semiconductor storage.

## Magnetic Storage

### Overview
- **History**: Early magnetic storage included tapes, then evolved to hard disk drives (HDDs) and floppy disks.
- **Mechanism**: Uses a read/write head to magnetize material on a disk to represent data.

### Types

1. **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)**
   - **Function**: Main storage for operating systems, software, and files.
   - **Capacity**: Modern HDDs can store multiple terabytes (TB) of data.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for storing large volumes of data, such as music, videos, and software.

2. **Floppy Disks**
   - **Function**: Early storage medium for personal computers.
   - **Capacity**: 
     - 5 1/4-inch floppy held 360 KB.
     - 3 1/2-inch floppy held 1.44 MB.

3. **ZIP Drives**
   - **Function**: Portable magnetic storage device.
   - **Capacity**: Ranged from 100 MB to 500 MB.
   - **Downside**: Lack of backward compatibility with earlier models.

### Advancements
- Modern HDDs are compact, lightweight, and can store vast amounts of data, making them portable and easy to carry.

## Optical Storage

### Overview
- **Mechanism**: Uses lasers to read and write data on discs.
- **Advantages**: Durable and handles temperature fluctuations well.

### Types

1. **Compact Discs (CDs)**
   - **Capacity**: 700 MB, roughly an hour of music.
   - **Use Case**: Music storage and data backup.

2. **Digital Video Discs (DVDs)**
   - **Capacity**: 
     - Single-sided: 4.7 GB.
     - Double-sided: Up to 9.4 GB.
   - **Use Case**: Storing movies and large amounts of data.

3. **Blu-ray Discs**
   - **Capacity**: Significantly higher than DVDs, used for high-definition video.

## Semiconductor Storage

### Overview
- **Mechanism**: Made of silicon, stores data using electrical charges.

### Types

1. **Flash Drives**
   - **Function**: Portable storage device with USB technology.
   - **Capacity**: Can exceed 1 TB.
   - **Use Case**: High-speed data transfer and portability.

2. **Solid State Drives (SSDs)**
   - **Function**: High-performance storage, faster than HDDs.
   - **Capacity**: Typically ranges from 128 GB to several TB.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for operating systems, applications, and storage where speed is crucial.

3. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**
   - **Function**: Volatile memory used for processing tasks while the computer is running.
   - **Capacity**: Measured in GB, typically 4 GB to 32 GB in consumer PCs.

### Characteristics
- Portability and flexibility make semiconductor devices favorable for modern computing needs.
- **Bluetooth and Wireless Connectivity**: Many external storage devices support Bluetooth or wireless connectivity, enabling network-based access without physical connections.

## Cloud Storage

### Overview
- **Definition**: Uses the internet to store data remotely on servers.
- **Accessibility**: Can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.
- **Function**: Acts as a backup and additional storage option.

### Characteristics
- **Free and Paid Options**: Free services typically offer 2 GB to 10 GB, with paid plans providing more storage.
- **Integration with Cloud Computing**: Cloud storage supports applications and can be used for real-time collaboration.

### Use Case
- **Backup Storage**: Protects data against local hardware failures.
- **File Sharing**: Easy to share files across different locations and devices.
