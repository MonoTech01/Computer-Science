# Computer Memory

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

- **Definition**: The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for interpreting and executing instructions.
- **Speed Measurement**: 
  - Measured in gigahertz (GHz), indicating billions of cycles per second.
  - Hertz (Hz) is the basic measurement, indicating one cycle per second.

### CPU Core

- **Core Function**: Drives tasks being performed by the CPU.
- **Multi-Core CPUs**: 
  - Modern CPUs have multiple cores (quad-core, octa-core), significantly increasing power and performance.
  - Allows multitasking, such as running Excel, Spotify, Word, etc., simultaneously.

## Types of Memory

### Read-Only Memory (ROM)

- **Definition**: Non-volatile, permanent memory.
- **Function**: 
  - Used during startup to engage the operating system and run software programs.
  - Retains data even after the computer is turned off.
- **Storage**: Typically 4 to 8 megabytes (MB) per chip.

### Random-Access Memory (RAM)

- **Definition**: Volatile, temporary memory.
- **Function**: 
  - Used during runtime to hold information for current programs and processes.
  - Allows quick access for the CPU.
- **Clearing**: All data is lost when the computer is turned off.
- **Installation**: Located in slots on the motherboard.
- **Capacity**: Commonly range from 1 to 256 gigabytes (GB) per RAM chip.
- **Types**: DDR3 and DDR4 (Double Data Rate, versions 3 and 4).
  - Ensure compatibility with the motherboard specifications.

### Cache Memory

- **Definition**: Volatile, temporary memory, similar to RAM but faster.
- **Function**: 
  - Boosts performance by storing instructions for repeated tasks.
  - Reduces the need for data to travel from RAM to CPU for frequently executed commands.

### Summary of Memory Types

| Type | Volatility      | Function                   | Behavior After Shutdown |
|------|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| ROM  | Non-volatile    | Used at start-up           | Remains                 |
| RAM  | Volatile        | Used during run time       | Disappears              |
| Cache| Volatile        | Boosts performance         | Disappears              |

## Other Key Components

### Motherboard

- **Definition**: The main circuit board that connects and holds crucial components.
- **Components**: Houses the CPU, RAM, ROM, cache, and connectors for other peripherals.

### Hard Drive

- **Definition**: Stores digital data, such as software and files.
- **Connection**: Connected to the motherboard via electrical wires.
- **Capacity**: Typically starts at 1 terabyte (TB) and can go up to 2.5 TB or more.

### Video Card (Graphics Card)

- **Definition**: Processes images for display.
- **Function**: Important for gaming and digital art, often includes a dedicated CPU for better performance.

### Sound Card

- **Definition**: Processes and outputs audio.
- **Function**: Connects to internal speakers or external audio devices.

### Network Connections

- **Wireless LAN (WLAN) Card**: Enables wireless internet connectivity.
- **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: Allows for wired network connections, slightly larger than phone cable ports.

### Optical Drives

- **Definition**: Devices that read and write data using lasers.
- **Types**: Include DVD and CD drives, less common in newer laptops due to cloud storage.

### Peripherals

- **Definition**: External devices connected to the computer.
- **Examples**: Monitors, printers, keyboards, mice, speakers, microphones.
- **Connection**: Via USB ports, Bluetooth for wireless peripherals.

## Choosing Between Desktop and Laptop

- **Desktop**: 
  - More features and computing power.
  - Suitable for stationary use.
- **Laptop**: 
  - Portable and compact.
  - Ideal for users needing mobility, like students and business professionals.
