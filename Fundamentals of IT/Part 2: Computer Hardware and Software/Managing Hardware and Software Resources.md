# Application Software vs. Operating System Software
## What is Application Software?

- **Definition**: Software that enables users to perform tasks and activities on their computer.
- **Examples**: Playing games, browsing the internet, listening to music, typing papers, creating presentations.
- **Function**: Interfaces with users to perform specific activities.

### Application Software in Action
- **Example**: Listening to music.
  - **Process**: The music player (application software) reads music files and relies on the OS to send audio to speakers.

## What is Operating System Software?

- **Definition**: Software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides essential services for application software.
- **Roles**:
  - Processes startup instructions.
  - Communicates between application software and hardware.
  - Maintains system performance.
  - Allows user settings customization.
  
### OS in Action
- **Example**: Printing a document.
  - **Process**: The word processor requests the OS to send print commands to the printer.

## Key Components of an OS

- **Memory Management**: Handles allocation and deallocation of memory.
- **Disk Storage Management**: Manages data storage, retrieval, and organization.
- **Processor Management**: Allocates CPU time to various tasks.
- **Software Management**: Manages installation, execution, and removal of software.
- **Removable Devices**: Manages external devices like USB flash drives.
- **Input Devices**: Handles keyboards, mice, and other input devices.

## How the OS Manages Hardware and Software

- **Drivers**: Software that tells the OS how to interact with hardware.
- **Plug and Play (PnP)**: Automatically detects and configures new hardware.
- **Resource Management**:
  - **IRQ (Interrupt Request Line)**: Alerts CPU to process hardware requests.
  - **I/O Address**: Identifies hardware device address for communication.
  - **Memory Addresses**: Treats device addresses as memory locations.
  - **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**: Channels for data transfer between hardware and memory.

## Issues with Software and Hardware

- **Common Problems**:
  - USB devices not working.
  - Compatibility issues with new OS versions.
  - Driver errors needing updates.
- **Solutions**:
  - Update drivers.
  - Check for OS updates.
  - Upgrade hardware for better compatibility with newer OS.

## Practical Tips

- **Upgrading OS**: Always back up user files to avoid data loss.
- **Maintaining System Performance**: Regular updates and hardware checks can prolong device lifespan.

## High-Level Overview of OS Processes

```plaintext
User(System Resource)	Process
Hardware	IRQ	Hardware gets the CPU's attention using IRQ
Software	I/O	Confirms the device's address by reading the device's I/O address
Software	Memory	Software treats the device's address like a memory address
Software	DMA	A DMA channel passes data between the hardware device and the memory address the software identified
