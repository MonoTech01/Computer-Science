# Info Systems Concepts

## What is an Information System?
- **Definition**: 
  - Software that organizes and analyzes data.
  - **Purpose**: Transforms raw data into useful information for decision making.
  - **Difference**: Data are basic values or facts; information is organized data used to answer questions and solve problems.

## General Purpose vs. Specialized Information Systems

### General Purpose Information Systems
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**:
  - Combines software and data to organize and analyze data.
  - Not specific to any organization or type of analysis.
- **Electronic Spreadsheets**:
  - Basic data analysis using formulas.
  - Examples: Calculating averages, plotting trends over time.

### Specialized Information Systems
- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**:
  - Integrates management of internal and external information across an entire organization.
- **Geographic Information System (GIS)**:
  - Manages and analyzes geographical data.
- **Expert Systems**:
  - Solves complex problems by emulating the reasoning of experts.

## Typical Components of Information Systems

1. **Hardware**:
   - Includes processors, monitors, keyboards, and printers.
2. **Software**:
   - Programs used to organize, process, and analyze data.
3. **Databases**:
   - Collection of data organized into tables and files.
4. **Network**:
   - Connects different elements, facilitating shared use within an organization.
5. **Procedures**:
   - Guidelines on how data is processed and analyzed to answer specific questions.

- **First Four Components**: General Information Technology (IT).
- **Fifth Component (Procedures)**: Specific to the question being answered.

## Different Types of Information Systems

### Organizational Hierarchy Example: Bookstore Chain

1. **Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)**:
   - **Users**: Store clerks and cashiers.
   - **Function**: Process daily transactions like receiving and selling books.

2. **Management Information Systems (MIS)**:
   - **Users**: Individual store managers.
   - **Function**: Schedule staffing, track deliveries, and finances on a store level.

3. **Decision Support Systems (DSS)**:
   - **Users**: Senior managers.
   - **Function**: 
     - Ensure smooth operation of the entire chain.
     - Manage logistics, inventory, sales, and personnel.

4. **Executive Information Systems (EIS)**:
   - **Users**: Executive-level managers.
   - **Function**:
     - Make strategic decisions like new store locations, market identification, and developing online presence.

### Pyramid Model in Usage
- **Bottom to Top Flow**: Sales information from TPS informs strategic decisions at executive levels, helping identify successful products and stores.
