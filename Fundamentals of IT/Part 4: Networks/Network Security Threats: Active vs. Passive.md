# Network Security Threats: Active vs. Passive

## Active Threats

* **Definition:**  Threats that actively seek to disrupt, modify, or destroy data or network resources.
* **Examples:**

    * **Canvassing:**  Scanning networks for vulnerabilities to exploit.
    * **Data Modification:** Altering or corrupting data (e.g., changing financial transactions, redirecting deliveries).
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwhelming a network with traffic to make it unavailable to legitimate users.
    * **Masquerade:** Impersonating a legitimate user to gain unauthorized access.
    * **Repudiation:**  Denying responsibility for malicious actions.
    * **Replay:**  Capturing and retransmitting network messages to cause disruption or gain unauthorized access.
    * **Cryptojacking:** Hijacking computing resources to mine cryptocurrency without the owner's consent.

## Passive Threats

* **Definition:** Threats that focus on monitoring and gathering information without directly affecting data or network resources.
* **Examples:**

    * **Sniffer Attack:**  Capturing network traffic to intercept sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers).
    * **Man in the Middle:**  Intercepting communication between two parties to eavesdrop or modify data in transit.
    * **Release of Message Content:**  Accessing and disclosing the content of confidential communications.
    * **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in database systems to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.
    * **Traffic Analysis:**  Observing network traffic patterns to infer information about communication and user behavior.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Active Threats | Passive Threats |
|---|---|---|
| **Intent** | Disrupt, modify, or destroy | Monitor and gather information |
| **Impact** | Direct and noticeable | Indirect and often undetected |
| **Detection** | Relatively easier to detect | More difficult to detect |
