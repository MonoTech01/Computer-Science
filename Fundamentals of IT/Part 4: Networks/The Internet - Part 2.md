# The Internet: A Deep Dive

## The Internet - Review

* **Definition:** A global system of interconnected computer networks facilitating communication and data exchange.
* **Key Features:** Decentralized, diverse network technologies, open communication protocols.
* **ARPANET (1969):** The precursor to the internet, a military-funded project focused on resilient communication.
* **NSFNET (1981):** A network for academic institutions, eventually evolving into the modern internet.

## Key Components and Processes

### 1. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)

* **Purpose:**  Unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet.
* **Format:** Four sets of numbers (0-255), e.g., 192.168.1.1.
* **Function:** Enables devices to be located and communicate with each other.

### 2. Internet Service Provider (ISP)

* **Role:**  Provides access to the internet for individuals and organizations.
* **Examples:** Comcast, Verizon, AT&T.
* **Function:**  Connects users to the global network and manages internet traffic.

### 3. Communication Protocols (TCP/IP)

* **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):**  A suite of protocols that defines how data is transmitted over the internet.
* **Function:**  Establishes rules for data packetization, addressing, routing, and reassembly.

### 4. Domain Name System (DNS)

* **Purpose:** Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
* **Structure:**  Distributed database spread across multiple servers.
* **Function:**  Acts like a phonebook for the internet, directing requests to the correct servers.

### 5. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

* **Definition:**  A web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet.
* **Components:**
    * **Protocol:** (e.g., http, https)
    * **Domain Name:** (e.g., google.com)
    * **Path:** (e.g., /search)
* **Function:**  Provides a standardized way to access web pages and other resources.

### 6. ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)

* **Role:**  Non-profit organization responsible for managing and coordinating the internet's core functions, including IP addresses and DNS.

### 7. Retrieving a Webpage:

1. **User Request:** The user enters a URL into a web browser.
2. **DNS Lookup:**  The browser contacts a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
3. **Server Connection:** The browser establishes a connection with the server at the specified IP address.
4. **Data Transfer:** The server sends the requested web page data as packets.
5. **Packet Reassembly:** The browser reassembles the packets to display the web page.
