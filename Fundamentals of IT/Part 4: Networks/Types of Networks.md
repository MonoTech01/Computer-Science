# Types of Computer Networks

LAN, WAN, WLAN, MAN, SAN, PAN, EPN & VPN

## Classification

Computer networks are classified based on their **size** and **purpose**.

## Network Types by Size

* **Personal Area Network (PAN):**  Connects devices around a single person, typically within a small area (e.g., home office, room). Example: Bluetooth headphones connected to a smartphone.
* **Local Area Network (LAN):** Connects devices within a limited area, like a building or office.  Often relies on wired connections for speed and security. Example: Office network with shared printers and file servers.
* **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN):**  A LAN that uses wireless connections (Wi-Fi).
* **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):**  Spans a larger area, like a city or campus. Often connects multiple LANs.  Example: A university network connecting various buildings and departments.
* **Wide Area Network (WAN):**  Covers a large geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs and MANs. Example: The Internet. 

## Network Types by Purpose

* **Storage Area Network (SAN):**  Dedicated network for data storage, providing centralized storage accessible to specific users or systems. 
* **Enterprise Private Network (EPN):** A private network controlled by a single organization, connecting multiple locations.  Offers high security and control. Example: A bank's internal network connecting branches.
* **Virtual Private Network (VPN):** Extends a private network over a public network (like the internet), using encryption to secure data transmission. Provides secure remote access to a private network.
* **Home Area Network (HAN):** A PAN specifically for home use, connecting devices like TVs, security systems, and appliances.
* **Body Area Network (BAN):**  Network of wearable devices, such as health monitors and fitness trackers.

## Other Network Types

* **Campus Area Network (CAN):** A type of MAN specifically designed for a college campus.
* **Virtual LAN (VLAN):** A logical network that groups devices on different physical LANs, allowing for better organization and security.
