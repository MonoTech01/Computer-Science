# Client-Server Model

## Definition

* **Client-Server Network:** A network architecture where clients (end-user devices) request resources from a central server.
* **Examples:** Web browsing, online gaming, file sharing.

## How it Works

1. **Client Request:** A client (e.g., laptop, smartphone) sends a request for resources (e.g., web page, file) to the server.
2. **Server Processing:** The server validates the request and retrieves the requested resources.
3. **Server Response:** The server sends the resources back to the client over the network.
4. **Connection Closure:** The server may close the connection after fulfilling the request to free up resources.

## Advantages

* **Centralized Management:** Easier to manage and update resources on a single server.
* **Cost-Effective:** Reduces hardware and maintenance costs compared to peer-to-peer networks.
* **Simplified Troubleshooting:** Easier to diagnose and fix problems on a single server.
* **Enhanced Security:**  Easier to implement security measures and control access to resources on a central server.

## Disadvantages

* **Single Point of Failure (SPF):** If the server fails, the entire network can be affected.
* **Dependency on the Network:** Clients rely on a stable network connection to access the server.
* **Specialized Staff:** Requires skilled personnel to manage and maintain the server and network infrastructure.
* **Security Risks:**  A compromised server can affect all clients.
