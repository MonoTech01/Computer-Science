# Network Security Testing and Tools

Protecting network infrastructure and data from various threats, including unauthorized access, malicious use, faults, tampering, destruction, and disclosure.

## Network Security Testing

* **Purpose:** To identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a network's security posture.
* **Scope:**  Comprehensive assessment of various aspects, including:
    * User access rights and permissions.
    * Network hardware and software security configurations.
    * Data protection measures for incoming and outgoing information.
    * Security of network access points (workstations, wireless, remote access, internet).
    * Logging and monitoring mechanisms.
    * Effectiveness of security policies and procedures.

## Tools for Network Security Testing

### 1. Monitoring and Logging

* **justniffer:** Protocol analyzer for capturing and inspecting network traffic.
* **passivedns:** Collects DNS records for network security monitoring.
* **sagan:** Log analyzer and rules engine for security event detection.

### 2. Scanning and Penetration Testing

* **Kali Linux:**  Comprehensive penetration testing platform with numerous tools for network auditing and vulnerability assessment.
* **OpenVAS:** Vulnerability scanner and remediation tool.
* **scapy:** Python-based tool for interactive packet manipulation and auditing.
* **nmap:**  Popular open-source utility for port scanning and network discovery.

### 3. Intrusion Prevention (IPS) / Intrusion Detection (IDS)

* **Snort:**  Widely used open-source IPS tool.
* **AIEngine:**  AI-powered IDS that operates autonomously.
* **sshwatch:**  Python-based IPS for detecting and responding to SSH attacks.

### 4. Other Tools

* **Cain and Abel:** Windows security tool for password recovery and network analysis.
* **Wireshark:**  Popular open-source packet sniffer for real-time network analysis and troubleshooting.
* **Splunk:**  Real-time network analysis platform with historical data storage for threat detection and security monitoring.
* **Forcepoint:** Cloud-based security platform for monitoring and controlling access to cloud resources.
* **BV-Control:** Automated security assessment and remediation tool.
