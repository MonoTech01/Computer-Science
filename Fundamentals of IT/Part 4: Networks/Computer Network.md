# Computer Network

## Definition

* **Computer Network:** A set of interconnected computers (nodes) that share resources.
* **Connections:**  Cabling (Ethernet, fiber optic) or wireless (Wi-Fi).

## Ethernet

* **Technology:**  Used to physically connect devices to a network (LAN or WAN).
* **Foundation:**  Defines how devices communicate over a network.

## Network Topologies

* **Star Topology:**
    * Central node (hub, switch, router) connects to each computer independently.
    * **Advantages:** Easy management, single node failure doesn't affect the entire network.
    * **Disadvantage:** Central node is a single point of failure (mitigated by fail-over systems).
* **Bus Topology:**
    * Single cable connects all computers in a linear sequence.
    * **Advantage:** Minimal cabling.
    * **Disadvantage:** Cable break disrupts the entire network segment.
* **Ring Topology:**
    * Single cable connects computers in a circular loop.
    * **Characteristic:** Signal circulates until it reaches the destination.
* **Collapsed Ring:**
    * Central hub/switch with a ring topology internally, connected to computers via individual cables.

## Cable Types

* **Coaxial Cable:** Central copper wire with insulation layers, used for cable TV and internet.
* **Twisted-Pair Cable (Ethernet):** Copper wires twisted together, common for Ethernet connections. Offers noise reduction and efficient signal transmission.
* **Fiber Optic Cable:**  Glass or plastic core transmits data as light pulses. 
    * **Advantages:**  High bandwidth, longer distances without signal loss (attenuation), faster speeds.

## Wireless Networks

* **Wireless Access Point (WAP):** Connects wireless devices to the network.
* **Integration:** Wireless networks often connect to a central hub/switch in a star topology.
