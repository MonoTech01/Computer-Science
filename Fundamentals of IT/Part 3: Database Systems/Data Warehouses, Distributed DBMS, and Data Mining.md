# Data Warehouses, Distributed DBMS, and Data Mining

## Data Warehouses
- **Definition**: A collection of databases that work together.
- **Purpose**: Integrates data from multiple databases to provide new insights.
- **Storage**: Typically stored on centralized computer servers for controlled access.
- **Function**: Helps businesses make decisions by systematically organizing and understanding data from multiple databases.

## Distributed DBMS
- **Definition**: A database that consists of multiple interrelated databases stored at different network sites.
- **Challenges of Centralized DB**: 
  - Storage capacity
  - Security
  - Performance (especially with global offices)
- **Advantages of Distributed DB**: Faster data access and processing.
- **Characteristics of Distributed DBMS**:
  - Multiple network sites connected via communication systems.
  - Data at any site available to users at other sites.
  - Data management controlled by the DBMS.
- **Complexity**: Requires specialized database administrators to manage.

## Data Mining
- **Definition**: The process of analyzing and summarizing data to produce useful information.
- **Tools**: Uses sophisticated algorithms to discover patterns and relationships.
- **Applications**:
  - **Business Analytics**: Enhance sales by identifying product bundles or customer profiles.
  - **Fraud Detection**: Identify out-of-the-ordinary transactions in real-time.
- **Process**: Algorithms improve over time as more data is collected and analyzed.
- **Integration**: Widely used in businesses, particularly those with a strong online presence.
