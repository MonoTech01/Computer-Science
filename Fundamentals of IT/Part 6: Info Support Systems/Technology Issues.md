# Technology Issues: Privacy, Security, and Intellectual Property

**Balancing Act:** Companies face increasing challenges in balancing technology utilization with ethical considerations regarding privacy, information security, and intellectual property.

**Privacy and Monitoring of Employees:**

* **Privacy Policies:**  Companies implement privacy policies to define how employee technology usage is monitored and what information is collected, stored, and analyzed.
* **Monitoring Rationale:** Monitoring helps prevent employees from wasting time, acting inappropriately, or sharing proprietary information that could harm the business.

**Privacy and Information Security:**

* **Customer Concerns:** Businesses must address customer concerns about data privacy and security.
* **P3P (Platform for Privacy Preference Project):** Enables customers to control the release of personal information online.
* **COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act):** Requires verifiable parental consent for collecting information from children under 13.
* **Hacker Threats:** Cybercriminals pose a significant threat by stealing and destroying data, exposing private information, and engaging in unethical activities.
* **Security Measures:** Companies invest in technologies like honeypots to lure and monitor hackers, preventing future attacks.
* **CIO (Chief Information Officer):**  Manages security and privacy technology aspects.

**File Sharing and Copyright Infringement:**

* **Intellectual Property Protection:** Companies must protect their ideas, concepts, and creative works (protected by copyright, patent, and trademark laws).
* **Copyright Infringement:** Unauthorized use of copyrighted material (e.g., images, text) on blogs or other platforms.
* **File Sharing Concerns:** Illegal file sharing or sharing of proprietary information can harm businesses.
* **Piracy:** Using software without a license, resulting in financial losses for companies.
