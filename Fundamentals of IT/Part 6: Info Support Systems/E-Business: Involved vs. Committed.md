# E-Business: Involved vs. Committed

**The Bacon & Egg Analogy:**  In e-business, some companies are like the chicken (involved) and others are like the pig (committed). The level of involvement depends on factors like the nature of their product/service and their embrace of technology.

**What is E-Business?** 
Any business or communication conducted via the internet. Examples include online shopping, internet chat support, and video conferencing. The internet is the essential platform for all e-business activities.

**Factors Affecting E-Business Involvement:**

* **Product/Service Type:** Some businesses cannot be fully internet-based (e.g., dentistry, auto repair).
* **Technological Savvy:**  Companies need to understand and adapt to rapidly changing technologies to effectively implement e-business strategies.

**E-Business & Technology Integration:**

Companies that effectively utilize internet-based communication tools internally (e.g., Skype, video conferencing, Twitter) are more likely to integrate them into customer interactions. Examples include:

* Live chat for customer service
* Telemedicine for remote healthcare
* Online forums and blogs for product support


**Types of E-Business Companies:**

* **E-Business Enabled:** Organizations that operate both manually (paper-based) and online. The internet is important but not critical for their operations. Examples include medical offices, factories, utilities, and traditional stores.
* **E-Business Enhanced:** Organizations that operate exclusively online. The internet is essential for their existence and functionality. Examples include Amazon.com and online-only businesses.

**The Airline Industry: A Case Study:**
The airline industry exemplifies a highly e-business enhanced sector. Booking tickets, checking in, and accessing boarding passes are now primarily done online, demonstrating the internet's transformative impact.
