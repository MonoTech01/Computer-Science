# Applications of Management Information Systems (MIS): Financial, Marketing, Manufacturing & Human Resources

# MIS Applications

Many organizations are structured based on functional areas, often reflected in an organizational chart. Typically, these include finances, human resources, marketing, etc. Many of these functional areas have their own dedicated Management Information System (MIS).

## Financial MIS

A financial MIS provides financial information for managers to make daily operational decisions within the organization. Most systems provide these functions:

* Integrate financial information from multiple sources
* Provide easy access to financial information in summarized form
* Enable financial analysis using easy-to-use tools
* Compare historical and current financial activity

A financial MIS often has a number of subsystems, depending on the organization type. These include systems to analyze revenues, costs and profits, auditing systems (internal and external), and systems to manage funds. A financial MIS can also prepare reports for third parties, such as external auditors or shareholders.

## Marketing MIS

A marketing MIS supports activities throughout the marketing department. Some typical subsystems include:

* Marketing research
* Product development and delivery
* Promotion and advertising
* Product pricing
* Sales analysis

One common use of a marketing MIS is to produce sales reports, typically generated on a regular schedule (weekly, monthly, quarterly). Reports can be organized by sales representative, product, customer, or geographic area. This allows managers to identify successful sales aspects and those needing attention. For example, a manager can quickly identify a sales representative experiencing a sudden drop in sales and provide necessary support.

## Manufacturing MIS

Manufacturing is one area where information systems have significantly impacted. A typical manufacturing MIS monitors the flow of materials and products throughout the organization. It's used at every stage, from raw materials to finished products. Common subsystems include:

* Design and engineering
* Production scheduling
* Inventory control
* Process control
* Quality control

For example, building an airplane requires a sophisticated system for inventory and process control due to the sheer number of parts (often exceeding 100,000).  The supply of parts must be meticulously planned to align with the assembly schedule, ensuring timely delivery and preventing bottlenecks.

## Human Resources MIS

A human resources (or personnel) MIS manages all employee-related information, including past, current, and potential employees. It supports various HR activities like:

* Workforce planning
* Selection and recruiting
* Training
* Task assignments
* Administration of salaries and benefits

Returning to the airplane example, ensuring the availability of skilled personnel at the right time for design, assembly, and testing requires careful workforce planning facilitated by an HR MIS.
