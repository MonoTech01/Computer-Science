E-commerce infrastructure relies on computer-based systems and comprises both hardware and software components.

**Hardware Components:**

* **Servers:** Handle processing requirements.
* **Proxy Servers:** Act as intermediaries between external users and internal resources.
* **Load Balancers:** Distribute workload evenly across the infrastructure.
* **Firewalls:** Protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access.
* **Encryption Devices:** Secure data by converting it into non-readable formats.
* **Interactive Voice Response Units:** Provide automated voice interactions for customer service.

**Software Components:**

* **Content Management Systems:** Control user access to content.
* **Web Analytics:** Track website traffic and user behavior.
* **Text Analytics:** Provide text-based functionalities like spell checking and voice-to-text conversion.
* **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs):** Allow developers to integrate e-commerce functionalities into their applications.
* **Database Servers:** Manage stored information like customer accounts and product details.
* **Middleware:** Connect different parts of the infrastructure and enable communication between various systems.
